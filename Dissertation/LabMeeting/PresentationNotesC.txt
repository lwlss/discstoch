cells on solid agar 
slides 1 and 4 from video
high throughput microscopy 

highlight features in population distribution: bimodal 
novel phenotype that people normally dont have access to is non-dividing cells
both distributions have a long right tail; left is truncated 
usually picture sharp unimodial distribution but this data shows differently: 
1) mode 2) width 3) length 

Simulating a mixed population: put in the equations 

Population Simulations; heterogeneity give rise to apparent lag phase 
-curves are synthetic (simulated) 
-growth rate distributions are real 

Consequences of hetergoneity 

barcoding libraries of yeast strains; barcoding experiment would mimic fish plots 
competition experiment simulation 
go from mixed to almost clonal population in almost 2 days
