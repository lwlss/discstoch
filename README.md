Discrete stochastic kinetics for individual microbial microcolony growth curves.

![Yeast growing on agar surface](http://lwlss.net/talks/uqfa/videos/MicroOriginal.mp4 "Yeast microcolonies growing on agar")

Some [slides](http://lwlss.net/talks/uqfa) about microQFA.

Some [slides](http://lwlss.net/talks/discstoch) about discrete stochastic modelling of microcolony growth curves.

#### TODO:
* Add original project proposal email text and references
* Add links to Levy & Siegal papers
* Draft of full project proposal
* Add Python and R code for discrete stochastic model
* Parse data and write Python/R functions to extract individual growth curves
