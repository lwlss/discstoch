Some [slides](http://lwlss.net/talks/uqfa) about microQFA.

Some [slides](http://lwlss.net/talks/discstoch) about discrete stochastic modelling of microcolony growth curves.

Data obtained from [Levy et al. 2012] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348152/) and [Ziv et al. 2013] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840306/).

A paper by [Pin and Baranyi 2006] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1393193/) which may be of relevance to the project.

- [x] Add original project proposal email text and references (separate file)
- [x] Add links to Levy & Siegal papers
- [ ] Draft of full project proposal
- [ ] Add Python and R code for discrete stochastic model
- [ ] Parse data and write Python/R functions to extract individual growth curves
